You will receive a Markdown formatted financial document (SEC 10-K).\n\nYour goal is to extract specific metrics into a flat JSON object.\n\n### Extraction Rules:\n1. **Normalization:** Convert all numbers to their full integer value.\n   - Example: If the table header says \"(In millions)\" and the value is \"14,527\", output `14527000000`.\n   - Example: If the value is \"5.61\" (EPS), keep it as `5.61`.\n2. **Missing Data:** If a specific metric is not explicitly stated, return `null`. Do not calculate fields yourself (e.g., do not subtract expenses from revenue to derive operating income). Extract only what is written.\n3. **Negative Values:** Return negative numbers as standard JSON integers (e.g., -500), not strings with parentheses.\n\n### Target Schema:\n{\n  \"revenue\": <int or null>,             // Total Net Sales / Revenue\n  \"operating_income\": <int or null>,    // Operating Income / Loss\n  \"net_income\": <int or null>,          // Net Income / Loss\n  \"total_assets\": <int or null>,        // Total Assets\n  \"cash_and_equivalents\": <int or null>,// Ending Cash & Cash Equivalents\n  \"diluted_eps\": <float or null>        // Diluted Earnings Per Share\n}\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "ITEM 8.

Principles\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\").\nWe have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nEstimates and Assumptions\nForeign Currencies\nRevenue\nProduct Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\n63\nPART II\nItem 8\nRevenue Recognition\nNature of Products and Services\nRevenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.\nRefer to Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering.\nSignificant Judgments\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\n64\nPART II\nItem 8\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\nContract Balances and Other Receivables\nRefer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $ 4.5 billion and $ 3.8 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.\n65\nPART II\nItem 8\nActivity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| ------------------------------ | ------- | ---- | ------- | ------- |\n| (In millions) |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Year Ended June 30, | 2023 |  | 2022 | 2021 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Balance, beginning of period | $710 |  | $798 | $816 |\n| Charged to costs and other | 258 |  | 157 | 234 |\n| Write-offs | ( 252 | ) | ( 245 | ( 252 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Balance, end of period | $716 |  | $710 | $798 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n\nAllowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets:\n|  |  |  |  |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| (In millions) |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| June 30, | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts | $650 | $633 | $751 |\n| Other long-term assets | 66 | 77 | 47 |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| Total | $716 | $710 | $798 |\n|  |  |  |  |\n\nAssets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nCost of Revenue\n66\nPART II\nItem 8\nProduct Warranty\nResearch and Development\nSales and Marketing\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\"ESPP\") is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.\nEmployee Severance\nIncome Taxes\n67\nPART II\nItem 8\nFinancial Instruments\nInvestments\nDerivatives\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.\n68\nPART II\nItem 8\nFair Value Measurements\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\nInventories\nProperty and Equipment\nLeases\n69\nPART II\nItem 8\nGoodwill\nIntangible Assets\nNOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER

As of September 28, 2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $22.0 billion, of which $10.8 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company's effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, the Company uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws. Auditing management's evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. |\n\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 48\n|  |  |\n| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| How We Addressed the  Matter in Our Audit | We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management's assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management's process to measure the benefit of its tax positions that qualify for recognition, and the related disclosures. We evaluated the Company's assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained and the related measurement of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. Our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management's assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, the Company's communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company's tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For a certain tax position, we also received an external legal counsel confirmation letter and discussed the matter with external advisors and the Company's tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated the Company's disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial statements. |\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 2009.\nSan Jose, California November 1, 2024 Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 49\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\nSan Jose, California November 1, 2024 Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 50"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"revenue\": 391035000000, \"operating_income\": 123216000000, \"net_income\": 93736000000, \"total_assets\": 364980000000, \"cash_and_equivalents\": 29943000000, \"diluted_eps\": 6.08}"}]}

We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, legacy programs offering unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and the portion related to software updates is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\n54\nDeferred revenue related to the access to our FSD features, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions):\n|  |  |  |  |\n| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| Year ended December 31, | Year ended December 31, | Year ended December 31, |  |\n| 2022 | 2021 |  |  |\n| Deferred revenue- beginning of period | $2,382 |  | $1,926 |\n| Additions | 1,178 |  | 847 |\n| Net changes in liability for pre-existing contracts | ( 67 | ) | ( 25 |\n| Revenue recognized | ( 580 | ) | ( 366 |\n| Deferred revenue- end of period | $2,913 |  | $2,382 |\n\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021 was $ 472 million as of December 31, 2022, primarily related to the general FSD feature release in North America in the fourth quarter of 2022. We had recognized revenue of $ 312 million from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2020, for the year ended December 31, 2021. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022, we expect to recognize $ 639 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales.\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\nPayments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated with them, at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022 , we had also recognized $ 288 million in revenue due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously.\n55\nAutomotive Leasing Revenue\nDirect Vehicle Operating Leasing Program\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\nDirect Sales-Type Leasing Program\nServices and Other Revenue\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, sales of used vehicles, paid Supercharging, retail merchandise and vehicle insurance revenue.\nRevenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within Customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue related to services and other revenue was immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales\n56\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $ 863 million and $ 399 million, respectively, mainly due to milestone payments. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 171 million and $ 93 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2022, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $ 210 million. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $ 12 million in the next 12 months and the remaining over a period up to 25 years.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Leasing\nFor solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases . Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\n57\nCost of Revenues\nAutomotive Segment\nAutomotive Sales\nAutomotive Leasing\nServices and Other\nCosts of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services and parts, costs of paid Supercharging, cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle insurance.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nComprehensive Income\n58\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nNet Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders\n59\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock (in millions):\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |\n| 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |  |  |\n| Net income attributable to common stockholders | $12,556 |  | $5,519 | $721 |\n| Less: Buy-out of noncontrolling interest | ( 27 | ) | ( 5 | 31 |\n| Net income used in computing basic net income per share of common stock | 12,583 |  | 5,524 | 690 |\n| Less: Dilutive convertible debt | ( 1 | ) | ( 9 | - |\n| Net income used in computing diluted net income per share of common stock | $12,584 |  | $5,533 | $690 |\n\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split (in millions):\n|  |  |  |  |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, |  |\n| 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |  |\n| Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, basic | 3,130 | 2,959 | 2,798 |\n| Add: |  |  |  |\n| Stock-based awards | 310 | 292 | 198 |\n| Convertible senior notes | 3 | 29 | 141 |\n| Warrants | 32 | 106 | 112 |\n| Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, diluted | 3,475 | 3,386 | 3,249 |\n\nThe following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split (in millions):\n|  |  |  |  |\n| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, |  |\n| 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |  |\n| Stock-based awards | 4 | 1 | 6 |\n| Convertible senior notes (1) | - | - | 3 |\n\nBusiness Combinations\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAll highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents.

A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\nOperating Lease Vehicles\n62\nDigital Assets, Net\nSee Note 3, Digital Assets, Net , for further information regarding digital assets.\nSolar Energy Systems, Net\nWe are the lessor of solar energy systems. Solar energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nDepreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\n|  |  |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Solar energy systems in service | 30 to 35 years |\n| Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs | Lease term (up to 25 years ) |\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\n|  |  |\n| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |\n| Machinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture | 3 to 15 years |\n| Tooling | 4 to 7 years |\n| Building and building improvements | 15 to 30 years |\n| Computer equipment and software | 3 to 10 years |\n\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases.\nInterest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in progress is included within Property, plant and equipment, net and is amortized over the life of the related assets.\n63\nLong-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to thirty years .\nGoodwill\nCapitalization of Software Costs\nForeign Currency\n64\nWarranties\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years . We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions):\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |\n| 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |  |  |\n| Accrued warranty-beginning of period | $2,101 |  | $1,468 | $1,089 |\n| Warranty costs incurred | ( 803 | ) | ( 525 | ( 312 |\n| Net changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign exchange impact | 522 |  | 102 | 66 |\n| Provision for warranty | 1,685 |  | 1,056 | 625 |\n| Accrued warranty-end of period | $3,505 |  | $2,101 | $1,468 |\n\nCustomer Deposits\nGovernment Assistance Programs and Incentives\nGigafactory New York-New York State Investment and Lease\n65\nGigafactory Shanghai-Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits\nNevada Tax Incentives\nGigafactory Texas Tax Incentives\nDefined Contribution Plan\nWe have a 401(k) savings plan in the U.S. that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and a number of savings plans internationally. Under the 401(k) savings plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 90 % of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations.

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |\n| December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2021 |\n| Fair Value | Level I | Level II | Level III | Fair Value | Level I | Level II | Level III |\n| Money market funds | $2,188 | $2,188 | $- | $- | $9,548 | $9,548 | $- |\n| U.S. government securities | 894 | -

Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Our Company Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. All references to \"NVIDIA,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" or the \"Company\" mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries. Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation. In June 2024, we executed a ten-for-one stock split of our common stock. All share, equity award, and per share amounts and related shareholders' equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split. Fiscal Year We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 were all 52-week years. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments, investigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-marketable equity securities, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other charges, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Revenue Recognition We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Payment from customers, per our standard payment terms, is generally due shortly after delivery of products, availability of software licenses or commencement of services. Product Sales Revenue Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers. For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and MDFs which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners' activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. 57 NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) License and Development Arrangements Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period. Software Licensing Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with support, which includes the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Cloud Services Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but certain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support. Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract. We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs. Product Warranties We offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one to three years for products to repair or replace products for manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Stock-based Compensation We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, that are based on our corporate financial performance targets. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of PSUs that are based on our stock performance compared to market performance, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model based on performance targets probable of achievement. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, we estimate expected forfeitures based on our historical forfeitures. Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs We currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, 58 NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Foreign Currency Remeasurement We use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant. Income Taxes We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. As of January 26, 2025, we had a valuation allowance of $ 1.6 billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any anti-dilutive effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased and publicly-held equity securities. We classify these investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations. We classify our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders' equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the Other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Available-for-sale debt securities are subject to impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to 59 NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the Other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Publicly-held equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in Other income (expense), net. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024. Marketable debt and equity securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio maturities. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit. Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets of two to seven years . Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years . Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Leases We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 60 NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. In completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units. The quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business. Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets Intangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method. Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated. Business Combination We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred. Non-Marketable Equity Securities Non-marketable equity securities consist of investments in privately-held companies that do not have a readily determinable fair value. These investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer, or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. We assess whether an impairment loss has occurred on our investments in non-marketable equity securities, accounted for under the measurement alternative based on quantitative and qualitative factors. If any impairment is identified for non-marketable equity securities, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. 61 NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of significant expenses in operating segments. We adopted this standard in our fiscal year 2025 annual report. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures, including disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. We expect to adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2026 annual report. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures. In November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of certain additional expense information on an annual and interim basis, including, among other items, the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included within each income statement expense caption, as applicable. We expect to adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2028 annual report. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures. Note 2 - Business Combination Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement In February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp, or SoftBank, announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate it due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $ 1.4 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.

1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Our Company Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. All references to \"NVIDIA,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" or the \"Company\" mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries. Fiscal Year We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 were all 52-week years. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories and product purchase commitments, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, property, plant, and equipment, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of most of our server, storage, and network equipment from three to four or five years , and our assembly and test equipment from five to seven years . The effect of this change for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 was a benefit of $ 33 million and $ 102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $ 135 million and net income of $ 114 million after tax, or $ 0.05 per both basic and diluted share. Revenue Recognition We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Product Sales Revenue Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers. For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners' activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. 55 NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) License and Development Arrangements Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period. Software Licensing Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Cloud Services Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but certain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support. Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract. We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs. If a contract contains a single performance obligation, no allocation is required. Product Warranties We offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one to three years for products to repair or replace products for manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Stock-based Compensation We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs We currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions 56 NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. Foreign Currency Remeasurement We use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant. Income Taxes We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. As of January 28, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of $ 1.6 billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any anti-dilutive effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations. We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders' equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or 57 NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders' equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit. Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets of three to seven years . Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years . Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Leases We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities. 58 NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. In completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units. The quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business. Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets Intangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method. Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated. Business Combination We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred. Investments in Non-Affiliated Entities Our investment in non-affiliates consists of marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are investments in privately held companies. Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity securities include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The investments that do not have readily determinable fair value are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer, or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. We assess whether an impairment loss has occurred on our investments in non-marketable equity securities, accounted for under the measurement alternative based on quantitative and qualitative factors. If any impairment is identified for non-marketable equity securities, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. 59 NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new accounting standard to provide for additional disclosures about significant expenses in operating segments. The standard is effective for our annual reporting for fiscal year 2025 and for interim period reporting starting in fiscal year 2026 retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides for new and changes to income tax disclosures including disaggregation of the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures. The amendments in the standard are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied prospectively, with retrospective application permitted. We expect to adopt this standard in our annual period beginning fiscal year 2026. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 2 - Business Combination Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement In February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp, or SoftBank, announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate it due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $ 1.4 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing. Note 3 - Leases\nOur lease obligations primarily consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2025 and 2035.\nFuture minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of January 28, 2024, are as follows:\n|  |  |\n| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| Operating Lease Obligations | Operating Lease Obligations |\n| (In millions) | (In millions) |\n| Fiscal Year: |  |\n| 2025 | $290 |\n| 2026 | 270 |\n| 2027 | 253 |\n| 2028 | 236 |\n| 2029 | 202 |\n| 2030 and thereafter | 288 |\n| Total | 1,539 |\n| Less imputed interest | 192 |\n| Present value of net future minimum lease payments | 1,347 |\n| Less short-term operating lease liabilities | 228 |\n| Long-term operating lease liabilities | $1,119 |\n\n60 NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nOther information related to leases was as follows:\n|  |  |  |  |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |\n| Year Ended | Year Ended | Year Ended |  |\n| Jan 28, 2024 | Jan 29, 2023 | Jan 30, 2022 |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| (In millions) | (In millions) | (In millions) |  |\n| Supplemental cash flows information |  |  |  |\n| Operating cash flows used for operating leases | $286 | $184 | $154 |\n| Operating lease assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations | $531 | $358 | $266 |\n\nNote 4 -

reinvest approximately $ 1.1 billion and $ 250 million of cumulative undistributed earnings held by certain subsidiaries in Israel and the United Kingdom, respectively. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments as the determination of such amount is not practicable. As of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $ 1.6 billion and $ 1.5 billion, respectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period. As of January 28, 2024, we had U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 315 million, $ 342 million and $ 361 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 361 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 28, 2024, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $ 31 million, before the impact of uncertain tax positions, that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2025. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $ 1.6 billion, before the impact of uncertain tax positions. $ 1.5 billion is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely and $ 75 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2025. As of January 28, 2024, we had federal capital loss carryforwards of $ 1.4 billion that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2025. Our tax attributes remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of tax attributes may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the tax attributes may expire or be denied before utilization.\n76 NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nA reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |\n| Jan 28, 2024 | Jan 28, 2024 | Jan 29, 2023 | Jan 30, 2022 |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| (In millions) | (In millions) | (In millions) | (In millions) |\n| Balance at beginning of period | $1,238 | $1,013 | $776 |\n| Increases in tax positions for current year | 616 | 268 | 246 |\n| Increases in tax positions for prior years | 87 | 1 | 14 |\n| Decreases in tax positions for prior years | ( 148 ) | ( 15 ) | ( 4 ) |\n| Settlements | ( 104 ) | ( 9 ) | ( 8 ) |\n| Lapse in statute of limitations | ( 19 ) | ( 20 ) | ( 11 ) |\n| Balance at end of period | $1,670 | $1,238 | $1,013 |\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |\n| Compute & Networking | Graphics | All Other | Consolidated |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| (In millions) | (In millions) | (In millions) | (In millions) |  |\n| Year Ended Jan 28, 2024: |  |  |  |  |\n| Revenue | $47,405 | $13,517 | $- | $60,922 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Operating income (loss) | $32,016 | $5,846 | $( 4,890 ) | $32,972 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Year Ended Jan 29, 2023: |  |  |  |  |\n| Revenue | $15,068 | $11,906 | $- | $26,974 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Operating income (loss) | $5,083 | $4,552 | $( 5,411 ) | $4,224 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Year Ended Jan 30, 2022: |  |  |  |  |\n| Revenue | $11,046 | $15,868 | $- | $26,914 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Operating income (loss) | $4,598 | $8,492 | $( 3,049 ) | $10,041 |\n\n78 NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n|  |  |  |  |\n| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |\n| Year Ended | Year Ended | Year Ended | Year Ended |\n| Jan 28, 2024 | Jan 28, 2024 | Jan 29, 2023 | Jan 30, 2022 |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| (In millions) | (In millions) | (In millions) | (In millions) |\n| Reconciling items included in \"All Other\" category: |  |  |  |\n| Stock-based compensation expense | $( 3,549 ) | $( 2,710 ) | $( 2,004 ) |\n| Unallocated cost of revenue and operating expenses | ( 728 ) | ( 595 ) | ( 399 ) |\n| Acquisition-related and other costs | ( 583 ) | ( 674 ) | ( 636 ) |\n| IP-related and legal settlement costs | ( 40 ) | ( 23 ) | ( 10 ) |\n| Restructuring costs and other | -- | ( 54 ) | -- |\n| Acquisition termination cost | -- | ( 1,353 ) | -- |\n| Other | 10 | ( 2 ) | -- |\n| Total | $( 4,890 ) | $( 5,411 ) | $( 3,049 ) |\n\nRevenue by geographic areas is designated based upon the billing location of the customer.

Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 33\nApple Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the notes to consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. The Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company's fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Segment Reporting Beginning with the 2025 annual reporting period, the Company adopted the FASB's ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-07\"), which requires the Company to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly provided to the Company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"). In addition, ASU 2023-07 requires the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 using a retrospective transition method. Revenue The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities. Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents. Trade Receivables Trade receivables are stated at transaction price. Marketable Securities The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. Inventories Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 34\nDerivative Instruments The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income Taxes The Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the TCJA. Leases The Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate and retail facilities. Note 2 - Revenue The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company's Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company's Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company's expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\"SSPs\"). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company's best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company's process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud \u00ae , Siri \u00ae and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company's estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.

As of September 27, 2025, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $23.2 billion, of which $10.6 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company's effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, the Company uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws. Auditing management's evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws. |\n\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 49\n|  |  |\n| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| How We Addressed the  Matter in Our Audit | We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management's assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management's process to measure the benefit of its tax positions that qualify for recognition, and the related disclosures. We evaluated the Company's assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained and the related measurement of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. Our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management's assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, the Company's communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company's tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. In addition, we evaluated the Company's disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial statements. |\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 2009.\nSan Jose, California October 31, 2025 Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 50\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\nSan Jose, California October 31, 2025 Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 51"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"revenue\": 416161000000, \"operating_income\": 133050000000, \"net_income\": 112010000000, \"total_assets\": 359241000000, \"cash_and_equivalents\": 35934000000, \"diluted_eps\": 7.46}"}]}

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Our Company Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. All references to \"NVIDIA,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" or the \"Company\" mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries. Fiscal Year We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were both 52-week years. Fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week year. Reclassifications Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation. Prior period intangible asset gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization in Note 7 have been adjusted to write off immaterial fully amortized intangible assets as of January 30, 2022. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. In February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three to a range of four to five years , and assembly and test equipment from five to seven years . This change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2024. Based on the carrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment, net in use as of the end of fiscal year 2023, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2024 operating income by $ 133 million as a result of the reduction in depreciation expense. Revenue Recognition We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Product Sales Revenue Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are 59 NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nsold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers. For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners' activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. License and Development Arrangements Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period. Software Licensing Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Cloud Services Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Product Warranties We generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Stock-based Compensation We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line 60 NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nattribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures at least annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs We currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. Foreign Currency Remeasurement We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant. Income Taxes We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. As of January 29, 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $ 1.48 billion related to capital loss carryforwards, state, and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period. 61 NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations. We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders' equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders' equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount 62 NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n63 NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe aggregate purchase consideration has been allocated as follows (in millions):\n|  |  |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |\n| Purchase Price |  |\n| Cash paid for outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares (1) | $7,033 |\n| Cash for Mellanox equity awards (2) | 16 |\n| Total cash consideration | 7,049 |\n| Fair value of Mellanox equity awards assumed by NVIDIA (3) | 85 |\n| Total purchase consideration | $7,134 |\n|  |  |\n| Allocation |  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | $115 |\n| Marketable securities | 699 |\n| Accounts receivable, net | 216 |\n| Inventories | 320 |\n| Prepaid expenses and other assets | 179 |\n| Property and equipment, net | 144 |\n| Goodwill | 3,431 |\n| Intangible assets | 2,970 |\n| Accounts payable | ( 136 ) |\n| Accrued and other current liabilities | ( 236 ) |\n| Income tax liability | ( 191 ) |\n| Deferred income tax liability | ( 258 ) |\n| Other long-term liabilities | ( 119 ) |\n|  | $7,134 |\n\nWe allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox. Goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim indicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for foreign tax purposes. Goodwill arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and Networking segment. Refer to Note 17 - Segment Information for further details on segments. The operating results of Mellanox have been included in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021 since the acquisition date of April 27, 2020. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 10 % for fiscal year 2021.

Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD Capability features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available. Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer's lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n55\nDeferred revenue related to the access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions):\n|  |  |  |\n| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, |\n| 2023 | 2023 | 2022 |\n| Deferred revenue- beginning of period | $2,913 | $2,382 |\n| Additions | 1,201 | 1,178 |\n| Net changes in liability for pre-existing contracts | 17 | ( 67 ) |\n| Revenue recognized | ( 595 ) | ( 580 ) |\n| Deferred revenue- end of period | $3,536 | $2,913 |\n\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 was $ 469 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. We had recognized revenue of $ 472 million from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021, for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily related to the general FSD Capability feature release in North America in the fourth quarter of 2022. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023, we expect to recognize $ 926 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales. We have been providing loans for financing our automotive deliveries in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $ 242 million and $ 128 million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $ 1.04 billion and $ 665 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Automotive Regulatory Credits We earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. Payments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated with them, at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had also recognized $ 288 million in revenue due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously.\n56\nAutomotive Leasing Revenue Direct Vehicle Operating Leasing Program We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are generally required to return the vehicles to us. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $ 1.86 billion, $ 1.75 billion and $ 1.25 billion of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had deferred $ 458 million and $ 407 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program We have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\"), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Depending on the specific program, customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to return, the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for which there is a right to return, the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Our arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $ 215 million, $ 683 million and $ 369 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $ 164 million, $ 427 million and $ 234 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue. Services and Other Revenue Services and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging, vehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise. Revenues related to repair, maintenance and vehicle insurance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle components, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within Customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets. We record in Deferred revenue any non-refundable prepayment amounts that are collected from customers and unearned insurance premiums, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred revenue excluding unearned insurance premiums was immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. 57\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Sales Energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. For large commercial and utility grade energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales. In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using market data for comparable products. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. As part of our energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract. If an energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $ 1.60 billion and $ 863 million, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment terms. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 571 million and $ 171 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2023, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $ 3.43 billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $ 1.05 billion in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period. We have been providing loans for financing our energy generation products in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $ 31 million and $ 24 million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $ 578 million and $ 387 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. 58\nEnergy Generation and Storage Leasing For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet. For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases . Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $ 181 million and $ 191 million, respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives was immaterial. We capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales commissions, as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements. Cost of Revenues Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, FSD Capability ongoing maintenance costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned. Automotive Leasing Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles. Services and Other Costs of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and costs for retail merchandise. Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, overhead costs, freight, warranty expense, and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs. 59\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (\"HLBV\") method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third parties. The third parties' interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. For certain funds, there have been significant fluctuations in net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due to changes in the liquidation provisions as time-based milestones have been reached. Net Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders Basic net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect is dilutive. Furthermore, in connection with the offerings of our convertible senior notes, we entered into convertible note hedges and warrants (see Note 11, Debt ). However, our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive. The strike price on the warrants were below our average share price during the period and were included in the tables below. Warrants are included in the weighted-average shares used in computing basic net income per share of common stock in the period(s) they are settled.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock (in millions):\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, |\n| 2023 | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n| Net income attributable to common stockholders | $14,997 | $12,556 | $5,519 |\n| Less: Buy-out of noncontrolling interest | ( 2 ) | ( 27 ) | ( 5 ) |\n| Net income used in computing basic net income per share of common stock | 14,999 | 12,583 | 5,524 |\n| Less: Dilutive convertible debt | -- | ( 1 ) | ( 9 ) |\n| Net income used in computing diluted net income per share of common stock | $14,999 | $12,584 | $5,533 |\n\n61\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders (in millions):\n|  |  |  |  |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, |\n|  | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n| Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, basic | 3,174 | 3,130 | 2,959 |\n| Add: |  |  |  |\n| Stock-based awards | 298 | 310 | 292 |\n| Convertible senior notes | 2 | 3 | 29 |\n| Warrants | 11 | 32 | 106 |\n| Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, diluted | 3,485 | 3,475 | 3,386 |\n\nThe following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive (in millions):\n|  |  |  |  |\n| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, |\n|  | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n| Stock-based awards | 12 | 4 | 1 |\n\n62\nOur total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in millions):\n|  |  |  |  |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |\n|  | December 31,  2023 | December 31,  2022 | December 31,  2021 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | $16,398 | $16,253 | $17,576 |\n| Restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets | 543 | 294 | 345 |\n| Restricted cash included in other non-current assets | 248 | 377 | 223 |\n| Total as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows | $17,189 | $16,924 | $18,144 |\n\n63\nSolar Energy Systems, Net We are the lessor of solar energy systems. Solar energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nDepreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\n|  |  |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| Solar energy systems in service | 30 to 35 years |\n| Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs | Lease term (up to 25 years) |\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\n|  |  |\n| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |\n| Machinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture | 3 to 15 years |\n| Tooling | 4 to 7 years |\n| Building and building improvements | 15 to 30 years |\n| Computer equipment and software | 3 to 10 years |\n\n65\nWarranties We provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions):\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, |\n| 2023 | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n| Accrued warranty-beginning of period | $3,505 | $2,101 | $1,468 |\n| Warranty costs incurred | ( 1,225 ) | ( 803 ) | ( 525 ) |\n| Net changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign exchange impact | 539 | 522 | 102 |\n| Provision for warranty | 2,333 | 1,685 | 1,056 |\n| Accrued warranty-end of period | $5,152 | $3,505 | $2,101 |\n\n67\nGigafactory New York-New York State Investment and Lease We have a lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. We are required to comply with certain covenants, including hiring and cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the arrangement, the SUNY Foundation paid for a majority of the construction costs related to the manufacturing facility and the acquisition and commissioning of certain manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of such amount (refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies ). This incentive reduces the related lease costs of the facility within the Energy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of operations. Gigafactory Shanghai-Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits We have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai government has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in connection with eligible capital investments at Gigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies ). For the year ended December 31, 2022, we received grant funding of $ 76 million. These incentives offset the related costs of our facilities and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the capital investment within the Property, plant and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets. The incentive therefore reduces the depreciation expense over the useful lives of the related equipment. Nevada Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits of up to $ 195 million in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada. Gigafactory Texas Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a 20-year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we would receive grant funding equal to 70 - 80 % of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10-year agreement with the Del Valle Independent School District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount, in each case subject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas. This incentive is recorded as a reduction of the related expenses within the Cost of automotive revenues and operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2023, the grant funding related to property taxes paid were immaterial. Defined Contribution Plan We have a 401(k) savings plan in the U.S. that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and a number of savings plans internationally. Under the 401(k) savings plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 90 % of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Beginning in January 2022, we began to match 50 % of each employee's contributions up to a maximum of 6 % (capped at $ 3,000 ) of the employee's eligible compensation, vested upon one year of service. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $ 99 million and $ 91 million, respectively, of expenses related to employer contributions for the 401(k) savings plan. 68\nASU 2020-06 In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity. The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470-20, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debt instruments, the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share settlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities. On January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. We recognized a favorable $ 211 million cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Due to the recombination of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital was reduced by $ 474 million and convertible senior notes (mezzanine equity) was reduced by $ 51 million. The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation had the effect of increasing our net debt balance by $ 269 million and we reduced property, plant and equipment by $ 45 million related to previously capitalized interest. The prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. Note 3 - Digital Assets, Net During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we purchased and/or received immaterial amounts of digital assets. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded an immaterial amount of impairment losses on digital assets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $ 204 million of impairment losses on digital assets and realized gains of $ 64 million in connection with converting our holdings of digital assets into fiat currency. The gains are presented net of impairment losses in Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of our digital assets held reflects cumulative impairment of $ 204 million. Note 4 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill increased $ 59 million within the automotive segment from $ 194 million as of December 31, 2022 to $ 253 million as of December 31, 2023 primarily from a business combination, net of the impact of a divestiture. There were no accumulated impairment losses as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The net carrying value of our intangible assets decreased from $ 215 million as of December 31, 2022 to $ 178 million as of December 31, 2023 mainly from amortization. Note 5 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (\"ASC 820\") states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions): 70\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |\n| December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 |\n| Fair Value | Fair Value | Level I | Level II | Level III | Fair Value | Level I | Level II | Level III |\n| Money market funds | $109 | $109 | $- | $- | $2,188 | $2,188 | $- |  |\n| U.S. government securities | 5,136 | -- | 5,136 | -- | 894 | -- | 894 |  |\n| Corporate debt securities | 480 | -- | 480 | -- | 885 | -- | 885 |  |\n| Certificates of deposit and time deposits | 6,996 | -- | 6,996 | -- | 4,253 | -- | 4,253 |  |\n| Commercial paper | 470 | -- | 470 | -- | -- | -- | -- |  |\n| Total | $13,191 | $109 | $13,082 | $- | $8,220 | $2,188 | $6,032 |  |\n\nOur cash, cash equivalents and investments classified by security type as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following (in millions):\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |\n| December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 |\n| Adjusted Cost | Adjusted Cost | Gross Unrealized Gains | Gross Unrealized Losses | Fair Value | Cash and Cash Equivalents | Short-Term Investments |\n| Cash | $15,903 | $- | $- | $15,903 | $15,903 | $- |\n| Money market funds | 109 | -- | -- | 109 | 109 | -- |\n| U.S. government securities | 5,136 | 1 | ( 1 ) | 5,136 | 277 | 4,859 |\n| Corporate debt securities | 485 | 1 | ( 6 ) | 480 | -- | 480 |\n| Certificates of deposit and time deposits | 6,995 | 1 | -- | 6,996 | -- | 6,996 |\n| Commercial paper | 470 | -- | -- | 470 | 109 | 361 |\n| Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments | $29,098 | $3 | $( 7 ) | $29,094 | $16,398 | $12,696 |\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |\n| December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 |\n| Adjusted Cost | Adjusted Cost | Gross Unrealized Gains | Gross Unrealized Losses | Fair Value | Cash and Cash Equivalents | Short-Term Investments |\n| Cash | $13,965 | $- | $- | $13,965 | $13,965 | $- |\n| Money market funds | 2,188 | -- | -- | 2,188 | 2,188 | -- |\n| U.S. government securities | 897 | -- | ( 3 ) | 894 | -- | 894 |\n| Corporate debt securities | 907 | -- | ( 22 ) | 885 | -- | 885 |\n| Certificates of deposit and time deposits | 4,252 | 1 | -- | 4,253 | 100 | 4,153 |\n| Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments | $22,209 | $1 | $( 25 ) | $22,185 | $16,253 | $5,932 |\n\n71\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of our investments by stated contractual maturities as of December 31, 2023 (in millions):\n|  |  |\n| --------------------------------- | ----- |\n| Due in 1 year or less | $12,374 |\n| Due in 1 year through 5 years | 297 |\n| Due in 5 years through 10 years | 25 |\n| Total | $12,696 |\n\nDisclosure of Fair Values Our financial instruments that are not re-measured at fair value include accounts receivable, financing receivables, other receivables, digital assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, customer deposits and debt. The carrying values of these financial instruments materially approximate their fair values, other than our 2.00 % Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 (\"2024 Notes\") and digital assets. We estimate the fair value of the 2024 Notes using commonly accepted valuation methodologies and market-based risk measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit risk (Level II). In addition, we estimate the fair values of our digital assets based on quoted prices in active markets (Level I).

The valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets decreased by $ 6.46 billion and $ 1.73 billion during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and increased by $ 6.14 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. The valuation allowance decrease during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance with respect to our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets. The changes in valuation allowances during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were primarily due to changes in our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities in the respective year. Among our deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, we recorded a valuation allowance on certain foreign net operating losses that are not more likely than not to be realized. The remainder of our foreign deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2023, we had $ 10.31 billion of federal and $ 10.36 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income, some of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2024 for federal and state purposes. Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an \"ownership change,\" as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership changes or expirations. As of December 31, 2023, we had federal research and development tax credits of $ 1.10 billion, federal renewable energy tax credits of $ 605 million, and state research and development tax credits of $ 923 million. Most of our state research and development tax credits were in the state of California. If not utilized, some of the federal tax credits may expire in various amounts beginning in 2036 . However, California research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.\n85\nThe changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in millions):\n|  |  |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| December 31, 2020 | $380 |\n| Increases in balances related to prior year tax positions | 117 |\n| Decreases in balances related to prior year tax positions | ( 90 ) |\n| Increases in balances related to current year tax positions | 124 |\n| December 31, 2021 | 531 |\n| Increases in balances related to prior year tax positions | 136 |\n| Decreases in balances related to prior year tax positions | ( 12 ) |\n| Increases in balances related to current year tax positions | 222 |\n| Decreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of limitations | ( 7 ) |\n| December 31, 2022 | 870 |\n| Increases in balances related to prior year tax positions | 59 |\n| Decreases related to settlement with tax authorities | ( 6 ) |\n| Increases in balances related to current year tax positions | 255 |\n| Decreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of limitations | ( 4 ) |\n| December 31, 2023 | $1,174 |\n\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, we have accrued $ 47 million and $ 31 million, respectively, related to interest and penalties on our unrecognized tax benefits. Unrecognized tax benefits of $ 901 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. We file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") for the years 2015 to 2018. Additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2022 remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. The Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company's fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Revenue The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities. Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents. Marketable Securities The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. Inventories Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method. Property, Plant and Equipment Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis. Derivative Instruments The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income Taxes The Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the Act. Leases The Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 33\nNote 2 - Revenue The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company's Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company's Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company's expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\"SSPs\"). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company's best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company's process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud \u00ae , Siri \u00ae and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company's estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.

As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 19.5 billion, of which $ 9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.'s effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws. Auditing management's evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. |\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 49\n|  |  |\n| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| How We Addressed the  Matter in Our Audit | We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management's assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management's process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. To evaluate Apple Inc.'s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management's assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.'s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.'s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.'s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial statements. |\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP We have served as Apple Inc.'s auditor since 2009.\nSan Jose, California November 2, 2023 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 50\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\nSan Jose, California November 2, 2023 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"revenue\": 383285000000, \"operating_income\": 114301000000, \"net_income\": 96995000000, \"total_assets\": 352583000000, \"cash_and_equivalents\": 29965000000, \"diluted_eps\": 6.13}"}]}

consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\").\nWe have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nEstimates and Assumptions\nForeign Currencies\nRevenue\nProduct Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\n61\nPART II\nItem 8\nRevenue Recognition\nNature of Products and Services\nRevenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.\nRefer to Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering.\nSignificant Judgments\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\n62\nPART II\nItem 8\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\nContract Balances and Other Receivables\nRefer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $ 4.9 billion and $ 4.5 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.\n63\nPART II\nItem 8\nActivity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| ------------------------------ | ------- | ---- | ------- | ------- |\n| (In millions) |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Year Ended June 30, | 2024 |  | 2023 | 2022 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Balance, beginning of period | $716 |  | $710 | $798 |\n| Charged to costs and other | 386 |  | 258 | 157 |\n| Write-offs | ( 218 | ) | ( 252 | ( 245 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Balance, end of period | $884 |  | $716 | $710 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n\nAllowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets:\n|  |  |  |  |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| (In millions) |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| June 30, | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts | $830 | $650 | $633 |\n| Other long-term assets | 54 | 66 | 77 |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| Total | $884 | $716 | $710 |\n|  |  |  |  |\n\nAssets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nCost of Revenue\n64\nPART II\nItem 8\nProduct Warranty\nResearch and Development\nSales and Marketing\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\"ESPP\") is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.\nIncome Taxes\nFinancial Instruments\nInvestments\n65\nPART II\nItem 8\nDerivatives\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.\nFair Value Measurements\n66\nPART II\nItem 8\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\nInventories\nProperty and Equipment\nLeases\n67\nPART II\nItem 8\nGoodwill\nIntangible Assets\nRelated Party

Beginning in fiscal year 2025, the information that our chief operating decision maker is regularly provided and reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance reflects these segment changes. Prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business during fiscal year 2025. These changes primarily impacted Note 8 - Goodwill, Note 12 - Unearned Revenue, and Note 18 - Segment Information and Geographic Data.\nThe recast of prior period information had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.\nEstimates and Assumptions\nForeign Currencies\nRevenue\nProduct Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\n55\nPART II\nItem 8\nRevenue Recognition\nNature of Products and Services\nRevenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.\nRefer to Note 18 - Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering.\nSignificant Judgments\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\n56\nPART II\nItem 8\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\nContract Balances and Other Receivables\nRefer to Note 12 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.\nAs of June 30, 2025 and 2024, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $ 5.2 billion and $ 4.9 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n57\nPART II\nItem 8\nAssets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nCost of Revenue\nResearch and Development\nSales and Marketing\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\"ESPP\") is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.\n58\nPART II\nItem 8\nIncome Taxes\nFinancial Instruments\nInvestments\nDerivatives\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\n59\nPART II\nItem 8\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.\nFair Value Measurements\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\nProperty and Equipment\nLeases\n60\nPART II\nItem 8\nGoodwill\nIntangible Assets\nRelated Party Transactions\nRecent
